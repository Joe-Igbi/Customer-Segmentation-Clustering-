# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering-
Using Unsupervised machine learning to cluster a customers based on their spending habits

### Introduction 
In this project I will use cluster analysis to group customers based on their behaviours by analysing key charachteristics in their purchases. 
The dataset used is an Online Retail dataset which provides information on the Recency and Monetary value of each customer purchase and allows us to deduce the frequency. This is key as it allows the formation of a Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value (RFM) analysis. 


##### Customer Segmentation with RFM using Cluster Analysis.

RFM analysis is one of the most popular and effective segmentation methods of analyzing customer spending, with the goal of segmenting based on buying behaviours in order to allow for targeted marketing. 
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary Value. These are key charachteristics as they constitute important indicators of a customers spending habits. For example, Recency is a good indication of customer retention while Monetary value and Frequency affects a customers lifteme value. 

In traditional RFM analysis, ranks are assigned to customers for columns R, F and M usually between 1-5. The average of the three ranks then gives the RFM score, from which different clusters can be assigned. 

Here I will be using unsupervised machine learning to analyse the data and generate the most fitting number of clusters which should result in targeted customer groups.
